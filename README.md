## Project Description

This project is a terminal-based POS application developed as part of a programming fundamentals exercise.

The application allows a user to:
- Add products with prices
- Remove products
- Display all captured products
- Calculate the running total
- Clear the screen between operations
- Continuously run until the user chooses to exit



The goal of the project is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Functions
- Sentinel loops
- Lists and tuples
- Input validation
- Iteration using for-each loops
- Structured program design

## Features


| Feature | Description |
|------|------|
| Add Product | Capture product name and price |
| Remove Product | Delete product from list |
| Show Products | Display all products neatly |
| Running Total | Calculates total purchase value |
| Clear Screen | Keeps interface clean and readable |
| Continuous Loop | Runs until user exits |
| Input Validation | Prevents invalid price input |

## Program Behaviour

The program repeatedly displays a menu:


| Key | Action |
|----|------|
| 1 | Add product |
| 2 | Remove product |
| 3 | Show products and total |
| 4 | Exit program |

After each action, the program pauses until the user presses Enter and then returns to a clean menu screen.
